# College Prediction App

## Overview

The **College Prediction App** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the best colleges for students based on various input factors like entrance exam scores, academic performance, and other relevant details. The app provides predictions to help students make informed decisions about their college admissions.

Currently, the app is designed specifically for **TS EAMCET** (Telangana State Engineering, Agriculture, and Medical Common Entrance Test). However, we plan to expand it to include data for other states' entrance exams in the future.

## Features

- **Input data**: Users can input details such as:
  - Entrance exam rank
  - Gender
  - Caste
  - Branch preference
  - Academic performance (optional)
  
- **Prediction model**: The app uses machine learning models such as Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict the best college.
- **User-friendly interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, the app provides an intuitive interface for users to enter their data and receive predictions in real-time.
- **TS EAMCET-specific**: Currently tailored for students taking the TS EAMCET exam.
- **Expansion plans**: Support for other state entrance exams will be added soon.

## Technology Stack

- Python (core programming language)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
- Streamlit (for building the web-based interactive user interface)
